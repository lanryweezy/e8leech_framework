# This module would contain functions for plotting the lattices and their
# projections. This would be useful for visualizing the structure of the
# lattices and for debugging the implementation.
#
# The implementation would require the `matplotlib` and `plotly` libraries,
# which could not be installed in the current environment.
#
# Here is an example of how you could implement the interactive 2D projection:
#
# import plotly.graph_objects as go
# from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
#
# def visualize_e8_projected(points):
#     pca = PCA(n_components=2)
#     projected_points = pca.fit_transform(points)
#
#     trace = go.Scatter(
#         x=projected_points[:,0], y=projected_points[:,1],
#         mode='markers',
#         marker=dict(size=3, color='blue')
#     )
#
#     fig = go.Figure(data=[trace])
#     fig.update_layout(title="E8 Root System Projection")
#     fig.show()

pass
