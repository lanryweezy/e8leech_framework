# This module would contain functions for projecting the lattices
# into lower-dimensional spaces for visualization. This is a key
# component of the visualization module, as it allows us to view
# the high-dimensional lattices in a way that we can understand.
#
# The implementation would require the `sklearn` library, which could
# not be installed in the current environment.
