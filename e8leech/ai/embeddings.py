# This module would contain functions for embedding data into the E8 lattice.
# This would be useful for a variety of AI applications, such as natural
# language processing and computer vision.
#
# The implementation would require a trained neural network to learn the
# embedding function. This would require the `torch` library, which could
# not be installed in the current environment.
