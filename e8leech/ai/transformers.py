# This module would contain an implementation of a transformer model
# with an attention mechanism based on the E8 lattice. This could be
# useful for tasks where the data has some underlying geometric structure
# that can be captured by the E8 lattice.
#
# The implementation would require the `torch` library, which could not be
# installed in the current environment.
