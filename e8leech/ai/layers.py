# This module would contain an implementation of an E8 equivariant GNN layer.
# This would require the `torch` and `torch-geometric` libraries, which could
# not be installed in the current environment.
#
# The implementation would look something like this:
#
# import torch
# from torch_geometric.nn import MessagePassing
#
# class E8EquivariantLayer(MessagePassing):
#     def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
#         super().__init__(aggr='add')
#         self.lin = torch.nn.Linear(in_channels, out_channels)
#
#     def forward(self, x, edge_index):
#         return self.propagate(edge_index, x=x)
#
#     def message(self, x_j):
#         return self.lin(x_j)

pass
