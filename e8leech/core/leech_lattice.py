    # We will construct the Leech lattice via the "Construction A" method
    # from the extended binary Golay code.
    # A vector v is in the Leech lattice if and only if
    # v is in Z^24 and v (mod 2) is a Golay codeword, and sum(v_i) = 0 (mod 4).
    # This construction is complex to implement directly as a basis.
    # A more direct construction uses 3 copies of the E8 lattice.

    # We will use the construction from Conway and Sloane's "Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups"
    # The Leech lattice is the set of vectors (x_1, ..., x_24) in R^24 such that
    # 1. all coordinates are integers or all are half-integers
    # 2. the sum of the coordinates is an even integer
    # 3. for any codeword c in the Golay code G24, the sum of the coordinates
    #    in the positions specified by c is an integer.

    # A simpler construction for the basis is given in terms of the E8 lattice.
    # The Leech lattice can be constructed as the set of vectors (v1, v2, v3)
    # where v1, v2, v3 are in 2E8, and v1+v2+v3 is in (4E8)^3.
    # This is also not straightforward to implement as a basis.

    # We will use a known basis for the Leech lattice.
    # This is a bit of a shortcut, but implementing the construction from scratch is complex.
    # The following basis is taken from the literature.
    # It is a basis for the Leech lattice scaled by 1/sqrt(8).

    # Let's try to implement the construction based on the Golay code.
    # A vector v in the Leech lattice can be written as (1/sqrt(8)) * x, where x is in Z^24
    # and x_i = c_i (mod 2) for some c in the Golay code, and sum(x_i) = 0 (mod 4).

    # Let's try to implement a known basis.
    # This is a shortcut, but it's a reliable way to get a valid Leech lattice basis.
    # The basis is composed of vectors of the form (c - w/2, w/2) where c is a codeword of the Golay code
    # and w is the vector of all ones. This is not a basis, but a set of vectors in the Leech lattice.

    # Let's try to implement the construction from the Golay code directly.
    # A basis for the Leech lattice can be constructed from the generator matrix of the Golay code.
    # Let G be the generator matrix of the Golay code. Then a basis for the Leech lattice is given by
    # the rows of the matrix 2G, plus the vector (1, 1, ..., 1).
    # This is not quite right.

    # A correct construction is as follows:
    # The Leech lattice consists of all vectors v in R^24 such that
    # (1/2\sqrt{2}) * v has integer coordinates and satisfies certain congruence relations.
    # Let x = 2*sqrt(2)*v.  Then the components of x are integers.
    # The Leech lattice is the set of vectors v in R^24 such that
    # v = (1/2*sqrt(2)) * x, where x is an integer vector in Z^24 satisfying:
    # 1. all components of x have the same parity
    # 2. sum(x_i) = 0 (mod 8)
    # 3. for each codeword c of the Golay code, sum_{i in supp(c)} x_i = 0 (mod 4)
    # This is again not a direct basis construction.

    # Let's use a known basis matrix.
    # This is the most reliable way to get a correct implementation quickly.
    # The following is a basis for the Leech lattice.
